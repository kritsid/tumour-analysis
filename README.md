A tumor is an abnormal lump or growth of cells. When the cells in the tumor are normal, it is benign. Something just went wrong, and they overgrew and produced a lump. When the cells are abnormal and can grow uncontrollably, they are cancerous cells, and the tumor is malignant.

In this note book i have tried to compare the 2 tumors- benign and malignant i have added visualisatiion to show that how are these two tumors different then i have applied various classification models for predictions for given features that whether the tumour is B or M. i have also illustrated the importance of feature scaling.
